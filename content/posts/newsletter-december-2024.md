## News and updates

* **Our new dashboard is now the default for all users.** This has been a long time coming, and we are excited to have have everyone migrated over. The old dashboard will be [removed on Mar 11th](https://about.readthedocs.com/blog/2024/11/rollout-of-our-new-dashboard/).
* **[Link Previews](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/link-previews.html)** are now available in Addons. This feature allows you to see a preview of the linked page when you hover over a link in your documentation.
* We're adding additional documentation examples for documentation tools that are supported on Read the Docs. This month we added [Docusarus](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/docusaurus.html) and [Markdoc](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/markdoc.html).

You can always see the latest changes to our platforms in our [changelog üìÉ](https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/changelog.html).

## Upcoming changes

* We are working to allow extending default ``build.jobs`` in the new build system. This will allow you to customize the build process more easily, with things like ``build.jobs.build.pdf`` being able to override the PDF build. This is now built, and we're testing it internally before documenting it publicly.
* We are planning to move our official documentation to https://docs.readthedocs.com to make it more obviously official. This should be a seamless transition for users, but we will be updating links in our documentation and on our website to reflect this change.

## Possible issues

* [Deprecation and removal of embed API v2](https://about.readthedocs.com/blog/2024/11/embed-api-v2-deprecated/). It will be removed on **January 20, 2025**. Please update your integrations to use the new Embed API v3.
