Read the Docs has been building and hosting documentation for open-source projects since 2010.
We’re proud to be a part of the open source ecosystem,
and today we wanted to take a moment to thank one of our biggest supporters: **Amazon Web Services**.

We have been a member of the [AWS Open Source Credits](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-promotional-credits-open-source-projects/) program since 2021.
In that time,
they have provided us with **almost $500,000 in credits**,
which covers all of our server-related costs each year for the Community platform.

This post will cover a bit more about how we use AWS,
the infrastructure we run on it,
and how it helps us support the open source projects that rely on Read the Docs.

## Our infrastructure

Read the Docs has a pretty simple architecture,
because we have a small team of 5 people running a very large web service.
The major AWS services that we rely on are:

* **EC2**: We run our web servers, web workers, and build servers on EC2 autoscaling groups.
  This allows us to scale up and down as needed, leading to builders always being available when projects need them.
* **S3**: We store all of our documentation artifacts in S3.
  This includes the HTML files, PDFs, and other outputs generated by our build system.
* **RDS**: Our primary and replica Postgres databases are hosted on RDS.
  This allows us to scale our database easily, and we rarely have to think about it.

We use a number of other AWS services as well, including Cloudwatch for monitoring, Route 53 for DNS, and many more.

## A few of the projects we host

Here are just a few of the big projects whose docs we build and host:

- [**Jupyter**](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) – the open source project that powers Jupyter Notebooks, used by millions of data scientists and educators worldwide.
- [**Godot Engine**](https://docs.godotengine.org/) – the open-source 2D/3D game engine behind thousands of indie titles and student projects.
- [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) – the Python web framework powering everything from hobby APIs to production workloads at scale.
- [**Python Developers Guide**](https://devguide.python.org/) - the official guide for developing Python itself, maintained by the core developers.
- Tens of thousands of other open-source libraries. Scroll almost any `requirements.txt` and you’ll see at least one project whose docs live on Read the Docs.

                        Read the Docs plays a large part in enabling a small volunteer team to maintain our docs. Without the generous Community plan, we couldn't have afforded anything close to the CI/build resources that we got with Read the Docs.

## Features that make Read the Docs unique

There are many places to host your documentation,
but Read the Docs is unique in a few key ways:

* **Free for open source**: We provide free hosting for any open source project, with generous limits on builds and storage.
* **Versioning**: Easily version your documentation with tags and branches, giving users access to the exact version of the docs they need.
* **Pull request builds**: We automatically build pull requests, so you can see how your project changes over time.
* **Visual diff**: See a diff of the rendered documentation when doing reviews, allowing you to easily see what changed in the docs.
* **Offline formats**: We provide a way to download your documentation as a PDF or ePub, so you can read it offline.

## Thanks to AWS for supporting open source

Keeping all this documentation online, building every commit, storing every artifact, and serving content to the entire world—costs a *lot* of money.
We have been given almost $500,000 in credits from AWS since 2021,
which covers the lion’s share of our Community infrastructure bill each year.

These credits are important for us in a few major ways:

* They support open source by allowing us to give generous free tiers to any open source project, because we don’t have to worry about the costs of hosting.
* They support our team, because it lets us focus on building features that matter to our users instead of worrying about trying to cobble together funding for our infrastructure.
* They provide a better user experience, because we can use autoscaling builders, instead of a fixed pool of donated builders.

Without partners like AWS,
our Community site wouldn't be the reliable home for documentation that it is today.
