In the last year, we have been focusing ourselves on providing a better experience to readers of the documentation.
Today, we are thrilled to introduce our latest feature,
designed on top of feedback from readers to build a better experience for them in our platform: Read the Docs Addons.


## Full list of addons

<!--
TODO describe each of the addons into its own section,
similar to what we have in https://github.com/readthedocs/addons/blob/main/README.md

### Analytics

Analytics allows you to explore your documentation traffic to understand what are the pages your readers read the most.
With this data, your team is able to prioritize the work on these pages first over other with less traffic.
Besides, you can find out what are the terms your users search the most and
write documentation pages that include those terms so they can easily find them.

## How to enable addons in your project

To enable Read the Docs Addons in your project follow these steps:

1. Go to the [new beta dashboard](https://beta.readthedocs.org).
1. Click on the project you want to enable addons.
1. Go to **Settings**, then **Addons (Beta)** from the left bar.
1. Check **Enable Addons**.

Now you have Read the Docs Addons enabled,
readers of your project's documentation can start using these features.

## Moving forward

We have implemented Read the Docs Addons in a modular way that allows us to expand them in the future.
There are plans to keep adding more addons to this list and also re-implement some of the Sphinx extension we've created in the past
(e.g. [`sphinx-hoverxref`](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx-hoverxref)) as an addon,
making it compatible with non-Sphinx projects.
We are also open to suggestions for new addons!

## Conclusion

Read the Docs provides a lot of feature for documentation authors to simplify their workflow to keep the documentation updated,
providing pull request previews, automatition rules, versioning, translation, and many other features.

The introduction of Read the Docs Addons, empowers the readers experience as well, closing the circle between authors and readers.
Addons gives readers a quick way to find what they are looking for,
notifies them about reading the _latest_ version which may have features that are not yet implemented or,
an old version that may be deprecated,
gives them a way to quickly switch between versions and translations of the same page,
and much more in near future!
