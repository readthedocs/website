Versions are a core part of Read the Docs,
they let you host multiple versions of your documentation.
Each version has its own unique URL identifier (slug),
which is used to access its documentation (`https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/my-version/`).

This identifier is automatically generated from your branch or tag name.
but the resulting identifier may not always be what you want,
or you may want to follow a different naming convention for your documentation.

Now you can customize the URL identifier for each version of your documentation.
Check [our documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/versions.html#version-url-identifier-slug) for more details and limitations.
