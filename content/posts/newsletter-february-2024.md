## News and updates

* We moved our new blog posts to be published on our website, so going forward you can find it [directly on our website](https://about.readthedocs.org/blog/).
* We shipped an update that allows [Sphinx builds to share environments](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/11073). This should make builds of multiple formats faster.
* We shipped a few different security fixes that were found by Santos Gallegos, a member of our team. You can read more about them in our [security advisories](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories)
* We shipped an [updated settings page for Addons](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/11031) in our new beta dashboard. This allows enabling and disabling each addon.

You can always see the latest changes to our platforms in our [changelog üìÉ](https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/changelog.html).

## Upcoming changes

- We continue to work on improving Addons. Our goal is to default all projects to using Addons in Q2 of 2024. We are working on improving the user experience, and adding more Addons to make the transition easier.

## Possible issues

- We are investigating [removing support for VCS systems other than Git](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/8840). We have sent an email to all users who are using other VCS systems for feedback as a first step.
- We have [defaulted traffic analytics off](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/11056) for users of our new Addons. This default is to save on resources for projects that aren't looking at our analytics data.
- Our [beta dashboard](https://beta.readthedocs.org/) continues to be tested in public beta, and new functionality for Addons configuration is only be available in that new interface.
