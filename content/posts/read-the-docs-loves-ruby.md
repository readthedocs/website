We are happy to announce that **support for Ruby is now available** as an option for our pre-defined building tools ([`build.tools`](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html#build-tools)).
Projects requiring Ruby to build their documentation are officially supported on Read the Docs üéâ

## Demo project using Jekyll

As an example of a project using Ruby, [see a demo of the default Jekyll blog](https://test-builds.readthedocs.io/en/jekyll/) built and hosted on Read the Docs.
The following code is the `.readthedocs.yaml` configuration file used to build it:


```yaml
version: 2

build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    ruby: "3.3"
  commands:
    - gem install bundle
    - bundle install
    - jekyll build --destination $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html
```

As you can see, it's pretty simple to use Read the Docs with Ruby
and install dependencies with `gem` and `bundle` following the community standard patterns.


## More documentation tools supported

With the support for Ruby, a new door is opened for projects requiring documentation tools that weren't supported on Read the Docs before,
like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/), [yard](https://yardoc.org/), [rdoc](https://ruby.github.io/rdoc/), and many others.


## Try it out and give us feedback

We encourage you to give Read the Docs a try if you are using any of these documentation tools,
and take advantage of the extra features we provide to empower your documentation workflow,
like [pull request previews](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pull-requests.html) and [Git-based versioning](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html).

Please [let us know](mailto:support@readthedocs.com) how your experience is with any of these Ruby documentation tools, and how we might improve our support.
