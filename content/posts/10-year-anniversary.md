Read the Docs was started at a [48-hour sprint in 2010](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2010/aug/16/announcing-read-docs/), and grew to become a large part of the Python documentation ecosystem within a few years.
Based on that success and the stressed that come with it, we [created a company](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2014/oct/24/announcing-read-the-docs-for-business/) to focus on sustainability in 2014.
So we've been working on Read the Docs as a project for 14 years, and a company for 10 years.
This post will reflect on the last 10 years of trying to make open source sustainable.

## Our sustainability model

We tried a number of different ways to make a sustainable open source project, really a service, over the years.
The model that we've found that has worked for us currently is a version of the classic open source model:

* We offer a free service for open source projects, supported by a single, ethical, ad on the documentation.
* We offer paid services for companies that need more private repos, as well as support and consulting services.

We tried relying on donations and other optional support, but that didn't work at all, and left us with some [mental health issues](https://ericholscher.com/blog/2018/feb/7/the-post-i-never-published/).
We tried a model where we focused on paid documentation consulting and services, but that mostly took time away from actually working on the core product that open source projects rely on.
We also [experimented with grant funding](https://blog.readthedocs.com/czi-grant-announcement/),
which was a much more aligned source of funding,
but is a one-time source of funding.

The goal is to work on the core product each day,
and [our current model aligns the incentives](https://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/aug/31/funding-oss-marketing-money/) so that everyone who is using the product is supporting it in some way,
and we can focus on making things better.

## Lessons learned


## Gratitude

We are grateful to have a team of 4 folks working full-time on Read the Docs.
The support of the Python community, the Django community, and the broader open source community has been amazing.
We depend on the trust of the projects that use our platform, and we have a core value not to violate that trust.
We're thankful to be mostly bootstrapped, outside of 6% equity we gave to our incubator, so that we don't have to follow the enshittification path of many venture-backed companies.

We are also grateful for the sponsored services from many tech companies, most importantly [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
This allows us to focus our funding on the team and core code, rather than infrastructure costs.

## Next steps

Read the Docs started only supporting Sphinx, and now supports many other documentation tools.
We've also finished up a large "magic removal" branch that has removed our modification of build configuration,
with our [Addons](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/addons.html) built on top of any HTML output.

This sets us up to continue to support the documentation ecosystem as the tools evolve.
We're hopeful to have another 10 years of making open source sustainable, and work to support the open source community.
