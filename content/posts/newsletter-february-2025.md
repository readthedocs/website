## News and updates

* We migrated our official documentation to ``docs.readthedocs.com``, with the primary user documentation at https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/.
* We are working to improve the process of changing the slug of a Version. This will make it easier to change the URL of a version without creating a new version. This is currently being tested in production and will be available soon.
* We [added support for changing the flyout position in Addons](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/flyout-menu.html#position), which allows you to control where the flyout appears on your documentation site.
* Our [Visual diff](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/visual-diff.html) feature is getting closer to being widely released. This includes a user-facing UX for seeing what files changed in a PR build, and a way to see the visual diff.
* We [documented Addons customization patterns](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/addons.html#addons-data-and-customization) to help you understand how to customize Addons for your project.

## Upcoming changes

* We are working to implement a GitHub Application, which will allow us to provide better integration with GitHub. This enables granular permissions, organization webhooks, and other long-standing feature requests.
* We continue focus on polishing the UX around Addons, trying to make it easier to use and understand how to customize them.


## Possible issues

* We have [scheduled database maintenance on February 14, 2025](https://about.readthedocs.com/blog/2025/02/postgres-maint-feb-14/). There may be brief periods of downtime during this maintenance window.
* Our old dashboard will be [removed on March 11](https://about.readthedocs.com/blog/2024/11/rollout-of-our-new-dashboard/). If you haven't already, please switch to the new dashboard.
* [Deprecation of projects using Sphinx or MkDocs without an explicit configuration file](https://about.readthedocs.com/blog/2024/12/deprecate-config-files-without-sphinx-or-mkdocs-config/). This was fully removed on **January 20, 2025**.
