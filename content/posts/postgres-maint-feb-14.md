We wanted to make you aware that on **Friday, February 14 at 2:00pm PST (5:00pm EST, 22:00 UTC)**, Read the Docs will be having a scheduled downtime of approximately 2 hours.
This will impact both **Read the Docs Community** and **Read the Docs for Business**.
We expect the downtime to only last for 15-30 minutes, but we are scheduling a longer window to account for any unforeseen issues.

During this maintenance window, public documentation will continue to be online but new documentation builds will not trigger and the Read the Docs dashboard will be unavailable.
New builds and webhooks will begin processing once the maintenance is over.

To ensure minimal impact for our users, we are performing this upgrade during a Friday afternoon which is one of our lowest usage periods.
This maintenance window is for a required database version upgrade to PostgreSQL from our hosting provider, which we couldn’t perform in place.
While these kinds of things do happen from time to time, we haven’t had a scheduled downtime on Read the Docs in a few years. Doing this helps us ensure that our services perform well and have up-to-date security.

Thanks for your understanding of this maintenance downtime.

Read the Docs team
