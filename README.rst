Read the Docs website
=====================

This repository contains the site content and static assets used to build the
Read the Docs website. You can view this site at https://about.readthedocs.com

This repository includes:

A Pelican project for our site content
    This includes our site content as well as our blog.

A Pelican theme and series of templates
    The Pelican configuration uses the theme ``readthedocs_theme``, which
    extends the Pelican ``simple`` theme underneath by default. Webpack builds
    assets directly into the theme path.

A Semantic UI theme specifically for marketing content
    This should mostly be a stock experience, but with some customization for
    marketing content.

Usage
-----

Setting up your environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package uses Poetry to manage Python dependencies and CSS and JS assets are
built using a number of Node dependencies.

You will need the following requirements:

* Node.js version ``14``
* Python version ``3.10`` (any release ``>=3.6`` works)
* Poetry version ``1.2`` (any release ``>=1.1`` works)

Using ``asdf`` is recommended but optional. The ``asdf`` commands below will
install all system level dependencies for you, including Poetry.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cp .tool-versions-example .tool-versions
    $ asdf install
    $ asdf reshim

With the correct system dependencies configured, either with ``asdf`` or
manually, you can install all package level dependencies with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry install
    $ npm install

Local development and authoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Webpack handles all of the building of assets, running the development web
server, and hot reload for the site CSS, JavaScript, Pelican templates, and
Pelican content. This is the best way to make change to this repository.

All you need to execute locally is:

.. code-block:: console

    $ npm run dev

This will start an auto reloading web server. You can view the built site at:

http://localhost:8080/

Any changes to the theme static assets, page/post Markdown source, or our theme
templates will reload the page in the browser. Alternatively, type ``rs<Enter>``
in the Nodemon process to force a Pelican build.

.. note::
    Removing and adding files sometimes is not recognized by Nodemon. You might
    need to restart the ``npm run dev`` command periodically.

Building content only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you run into issues building CSS or JS, you can work around this temporarily
by running Pelican directly and viewing the output locally:

.. code-block:: console

    $ npm run build-html
    $ firefox output/index.html

You will lose out on all of the nice features of Webpack this way, so it is
recommneded to use the standard development flow instead.

Building assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For every pull request, assets need to be rebuilt, or the pull request check
will fail.

To generate production CSS and JavaScript assets:

.. code:: console

    $ npm run build

This will create all of the necessary files in ``readthedocs_theme/static/``, as
well as regenerate all of the site content through Pelican.

Linting and formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to other front end projects, and our Python code, we use automatic
linting and formatting for styling code to a unified format. For CSS/JS, we use
``prettier``, which is opinionated but mostly makes good code style choices.

Linting is required for every pull request, skipping this step can cause the
build to fail if your formatting doesn't match the intended output from
``prettier``.

To run linting checks, which will only report errors:

.. code:: console

    $ npm run lint

To automatically format code:

.. code:: console

    $ npm run format

Authoring content
-----------------

Pages
~~~~~

Pages should be saved under ``content/pages/``. If the pages are heavy in HTML,
the source file should simply be an HTML document instead of reST/Markdown.
By default, pages should use the ``readthedocs_theme/templates/page.html``
template but that can be overridden.

Blog posts
~~~~~~~~~~

Blog posts should be saved under ``content/posts/``.

Style Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~

Our style is loosely based on the `Wikipedia Manual of Style`_.

- Titles use `title case`_.
- Section headings (h2 and below) use sentence case and tend to be
  descriptive/substantive beyond a simple noun.
